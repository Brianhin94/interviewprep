##ASSIGNMENT
5. Create a basic PLP page in the code language(s) of your choice with 12 or so fake products and make a filter bar containing the 'Product Type' attribute that functions accordingly when selecting a filter (PLP list should filter out products based off chosen attribute).

Completed the given task within the first commit however I felt there was much more I could have done with the styling had I given myself more than a 3 hour window with the site.
I also took this opportunity to learn and implement bootstrap-vue which are two frameworks ive been familiar with but have yet to combine on one project.
